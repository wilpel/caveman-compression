My cat Mr. Whiskers was standing on a box giving what appeared to be a keynote address.\"\nHenderson claims the cats scattered immediately, but not before he observed a small podium constructed from cardboard and what appeared to be a voting system using ping pong balls.\n\"They had charts,\" Henderson said, still visibly shaken. \"Actual charts. I don't know how, but they did.\"\nLocal veterinarian Dr. Sarah Chen expressed skepticism about the claims. \"Cats are highly intelligent, but the likelihood of them organizing formal parliamentary proceedings is extremely low,\" Dr. Chen stated. \"Then again, I've never actually checked my own basement at 2 AM.\"\nHenderson's neighbor, Patricia Moore, wasn't surprised by the news. \"My cat Senator Fluffington comes home every Tuesday with what looks like meeting minutes stuck to his fur,\" Moore explained. \"I just assumed he was getting into the recycling.\"\nAt press time, Henderson reported finding a tiny briefcase hidden behind his water heater.",
