1. Why does Professor Marcus Chen's skepticism particularly frustrate Dr. Voss?
ANSWER: He dismisses her findings without considering the comprehensive forensic evidence she collected, and he's never encountered a mystery he couldn't rationalize, so his skepticism comes from inexperience rather than careful analysis.

2. What makes the 1673 map scientifically impossible according to the text?
ANSWER: It accurately shows Antarctica's subglacial topography (features beneath the ice) that were only confirmed by modern satellites in the past twenty years and are invisible without advanced technology.

3. What is the significance of Dr. Yuki Tanaka's ice core research in relation to Helena's discovery?
ANSWER: Tanaka's research also reveals impossible historical evidence (advanced metallurgy before it should exist), providing independent corroboration that anomalous discoveries exist and showing the professional consequences of pursuing them.

4. What does the phrase "Memoria terrae non moritur" suggest about the unknown cartographer's worldview?
ANSWER: The cartographer believed the earth itself retains knowledge across time, suggesting geographical information is intrinsic to the land rather than merely discovered by humans.

5. What evidence suggests Helena's discovery is being actively suppressed rather than simply doubted?
ANSWER: Her paper was rejected within 48 hours (unprecedented), her editor of 15 years won't return calls, Tanaka warned about "wrong kind of attention," and she receives a mysterious text implying organized interest in such discoveries.

6. How does the narrative structure create tension regarding Helena's career decision?
ANSWER: The story escalates from academic curiosity to professional rejection to hints of suppression, culminating in the mysterious contact and explicit statement that pursuing truth will cost her reputation, making her choice feel increasingly consequential.

7. What multiple meanings might the title "The Cartographer's Dilemma" carry?
ANSWER: It refers to Helena's choice between career and truth, the original cartographer's decision to preserve impossible knowledge, and the broader ethical question of what to do with knowledge that contradicts established understanding.

8. What does Helena's decision to photograph the map "one final time" reveal about her likely choice?
ANSWER: She's creating a backup before taking action, suggesting she'll attend the meeting and pursue the truth despite knowing she won't have easy access to the archive or her comfortable academic life afterward.
