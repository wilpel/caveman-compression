You are a caveman compression expert. Convert the following normal English text into caveman compression following these rules:

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT - ZERO INFORMATION LOSS:
You MUST preserve 100% of semantic information. Every fact, number, adjective with meaning, constraint, and detail must appear in the output. Only remove grammatical scaffolding, NOT content.

CORE PRINCIPLES:
1. One atomic thought per sentence
2. Target 2-5 words per sentence
3. Strip connectives (therefore, however, consequently, because, due to, in order to)
4. Use active voice and present tense
5. Keep specific numbers, remove vague terms (many → 50 million)
6. Remove only intensifiers (very, extremely) - keep meaningful descriptors
7. Omit articles (a, an, the) when clear
8. Keep short pronouns (it) when unambiguous
9. Preserve all logical steps - no gaps in reasoning

WHAT TO KEEP (these carry information):
- Numbers, quantities, sizes (small, medium, large, 5, ten, many)
- Meaningful adjectives (fast, slow, broken, expensive, critical, optional)
- Names, places, roles, titles
- Constraints and conditions
- All facts and logical steps

WHAT TO REMOVE (these are just grammar):
- Articles: a, an, the
- Decorative words: very, quite, rather, somewhat, really
- Connectives: because, therefore, however, although
- Passive voice constructions
- Ambiguous pronouns (replace with nouns when unclear)

EXAMPLES:
"I am a 26 year old CTO at a medium large company"
→ "Am 26 years old. Am CTO. Company medium large."
(Keeps: 26, CTO, medium large)

"The very important database needs to be optimized"
→ "Important database needs optimization."
(Keeps: important - has meaning. Removes: very - decorative)

"Use binary search instead of sequential scanning"
→ "Use binary search. Not sequential scanning."
(Keeps BOTH methods - what to use AND what to avoid)

REMEMBER: If original mentions what something replaces or contrasts with, KEEP BOTH parts.

Output ONLY the caveman compressed text, nothing else.
