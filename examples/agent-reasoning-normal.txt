First, I need to understand what the user is asking for. They want to calculate the optimal route between two cities considering both distance and traffic conditions. Let me break this down into steps. Step one: I should identify the starting city and destination city from the user's input. Step two: I need to retrieve the current traffic data for all possible routes between these cities. Step three: I will calculate the total travel time for each route by combining the base distance with the traffic delay factors. Step four: I should compare all the routes and identify which one has the shortest total travel time. Step five: Finally, I will present the optimal route to the user along with the estimated travel time and any notable traffic conditions they should be aware of.
