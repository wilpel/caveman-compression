If a customer reports that they cannot access their account after multiple failed login attempts, this indicates that the account has been automatically locked due to our security policy. To resolve this issue, you should first verify the customer's identity by asking them to provide their registered email address and the last four digits of their phone number. Once verified, navigate to the admin panel, search for the customer's account using their email, and click the "Unlock Account" button. The customer will receive an automated email with instructions to reset their password. If the unlock fails, escalate the ticket to the security team with priority level 2.
