A network router is a device that forwards data packets between computer networks. Routers perform the traffic directing functions on the Internet. When a data packet arrives at a router, the router examines the destination IP address in the packet header and determines the best path for the packet to reach its destination. The router uses a routing table, which contains information about network topology and the best routes to various network destinations. Routers operate at Layer 3 of the OSI model and make forwarding decisions based on IP addresses. Modern routers also include features like NAT (Network Address Translation), which allows multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IP address, and firewall capabilities to protect the network from unauthorized access.
