To authenticate with our API, you need to include your API key in the Authorization header of every request. The API key should be prefixed with the word "Bearer" followed by a space. If authentication fails, the server will return a 401 Unauthorized status code along with an error message explaining why the authentication failed. Please note that API keys are sensitive credentials and should never be committed to version control or shared publicly. We recommend storing them in environment variables or using a secure secrets management system.
